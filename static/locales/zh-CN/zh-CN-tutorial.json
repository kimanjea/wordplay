This is a function called \\even\\ that takes a single number called… \\number\\. You need to tell me what kind of value each input is, so @Evaluate can make sure that anything evaluating the function is sending the right kind of value. Then, it takes the number, divides it by two, gets the remainder (with the @Number/remainder), and then checks if the remainder is equal to \\0\\, with @Number/equal. So the whole function ends up either evaluating to \\⊤\\ or \\⊥\\. For example, this evaluation of even evaluated to \\⊥\\ because \\3\\ is odd. Try using the rewind buttons to see how it works."
